Driver Monitoring System for Fatigue and Distraction Detection: A Multi-Modal Deep Learning Approach

you can train the model from the model traning file, I have used the datasets which are specifed in the report which are available in kaggle, and then run the live detection file for the detection system. 
you can go through the report for detailed explanation
